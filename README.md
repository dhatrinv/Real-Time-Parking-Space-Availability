# Smart Parking System using Image Processing

## Overview

Nowadays, finding a parking spot in urban cities is becoming increasingly difficult as the number of cars continues to rise. To alleviate rush hour traffic in parking spaces, an effective car parking occupancy monitoring system is necessary. This project offers a system that determines if a parking place is filled or not using aerial photos taken by a camera. The system employs computer vision and fundamental image processing techniques.

This solution addresses the problem of parking spot detection by reducing the amount of time spent exploring parking lots, which in turn lowers carbon emissions and improves quality of life. Unlike current solutions that rely on hardware devices, sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), the CNN network, and multiple deep learning algorithms, the proposed solution eliminates this complexity and significantly reduces costs.

## Features

- **Image-Processing-Based Smart Parking System**: Designed for multiple parking garages, open parking lots, and more.
- **Edge Detection and Pixel Analysis**: The system identifies whether a parking spot in the received video is occupied by combining edge detection with coordinate-bound pixel sections.
- **Text Extraction**: The system demonstrates image-to-text conversion using Tesseract to extract text from processed images. To achieve optimal text extraction, various images undergo different levels of image processing.

## Implementation

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV for image processing, Tesseract for text extraction.

## System Architecture

1. **Input**: Aerial photos or videos of parking areas.
2. **Processing**:
   - Edge detection is applied to identify boundaries and features.
   - Pixel sections are analyzed to determine occupancy status.
3. **Output**: Status of parking spots (occupied or free) is identified.
4. **Text Extraction**: Processed images are used for text extraction using Tesseract.

## Benefits

- Reduces time spent searching for parking spots.
- Lowers carbon emissions by reducing idle time in parking lots.
- Improves overall quality of life by making parking more efficient.
- Cost-effective solution compared to hardware and sensor-based systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing.
- **Tesseract**: OCR engine for text extraction.
